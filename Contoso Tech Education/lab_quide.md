## Part 3 — Create a Storage Account (Standard_LRS)

1. In the Azure Portal, click **+ Create a resource**.
2. Search for **Storage account** and select it.
3. Click **Create** and fill in:

| Field | Value |

## Part 5 — Connect to Your Virtual Machine

### If you chose Linux (Ubuntu):

1. Open a terminal (PowerShell, CMD, or your system terminal).
2. Run:
   ```
   ssh azurestudent@<your-vm-public-ip>
   ```
3. Enter your password when prompted.
4. You are now connected. Run `hostname` to verify.

### If you chose Windows Server:

3. Click **Connect** → enter username `azurestudent` and your password.
4. You are now connected to your Windows VM.

## Part 6 — Explore and Experiment

Try these exercises within your allowed resources:

### Exercise A — Blob Storage Operations
1. Go to your Storage Account → **Containers** → `labdata`.
2. Click **Upload** → upload any small file (< 5 MB).
3. Click on the uploaded file → copy its URL.
4. Open the URL in a new tab (it will fail unless you set public access — this is expected).
5. Generate a **SAS token** for the blob and access it using the SAS URL.

### Exercise B — VM Management
1. Go to your VM → click **Stop** to deallocate it.
2. Wait for status to show **Stopped (deallocated)**.
   - Notice: the disk cost optimization will automatically downgrade your disk tier while stopped.
3. Click **Start** to restart the VM.
4. Reconnect via SSH or RDP and verify everything still works.

### Exercise C — Monitor Your Costs
1. Go to **Cost Management + Billing** in the Azure Portal.
2. Click **Cost analysis** → filter by your Resource Group.
3. Observe your accumulated cost.

> **Note:** If your usage reaches 70%, 90%, or 100% of the budget limit, your instructor will receive an email alert. Stay within limits.

---

## Part 7 — Clean Up (End of Lab)

Before your lab expires, clean up resources to save costs:

1. Go to your **Resource Group**.
2. Delete the VM first (this also removes the associated NIC, public IP, and disk).
3. Delete the Storage Account.
4. Verify the Resource Group is empty.

> Your environment will be **automatically deleted** when the 10-day duration expires, but early cleanup is good practice.
